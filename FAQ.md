## FAQ

#### Where do I start the COBOL Course?

#### How do I enroll for system access?

#### "I'm having a very hard time connecting with the mainframe.  What should I do?"
1. Post your .yaml file in the Slack Channel Forum, but don't post any passwords. .yaml location: C:\Users<your Win Id>.zowe\profiles\zosmf\LearnCOBOL.yaml. Hopefully, someone can help you spot the problem.
2. Try shutting down VSCode and relaunch.
3. If that doesn't work, shut down VSCode, try deleting the .yaml file, relauch and create a New Connection again.  Eventually, it will work.  Very buggy.
4. Also, you could have timed out, if you've connected before.  Need to re-Authenticate.  Shut down VSCode and relaunch.
5. If clicking on the "Refresh All" icon to the right of "DATA SETS" or the "Search Data Sets..." icon to the right of "LearnCOBOL" (also in the "DATA SETS" area) and nothing happens, try clicking on "LearnCOBOL" itself in the "JOBS" area.  This version (v0.4.9) of Z Open Editor is buggy.  If you receive, "Check Credentials" (Blue pop-up box appears), click it, re-authenticate at top.  Ignore any "rse" error messages. Continue anyway.
6. Other things to try, watch this video.  The presenter actually walks through the process, although I think it was with an older, more stable version of IBM Z Open Editor.  [Get hands on!
